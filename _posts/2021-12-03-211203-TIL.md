I finished the React crash course! ðŸ¤© I learned:

- Creating dynamic interfaces via change of states
- Creating production builds (and how they are different from development builds)
- The exact syntax of `useState()` function
- JavaScript spread syntax and interpolation

I feel like I got the hang of the basic components of React! The crash course was indeed a great entry point, but I still need some more understanding of concepts like hooks and states. Once I'm confident with React I'm also planning to dive into jQuery, then I can start a new project!
