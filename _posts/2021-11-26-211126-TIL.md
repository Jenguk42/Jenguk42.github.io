I continued working on the to-do list project! ðŸ˜‰

I looked at:

- How to dynamically store the input from the user
- Difference between `document.write()` and `Element.innerHTML`
- Exact definition of `Node`, `Element`, and `Document` interface and how they are related

I was not sure why the saved input would load on a new page, then found out that `document.write()` writes on a document stream and it should only be used when loading the page for the first time.

I spent most of my time today trying to get a better understanding of the Web APIs, so the html page looks pretty much the same as yesterday.

The next steps are:

1. Dynamically storing the input using `createTextNode` and `appendChild`
1. The rest (Creating a delete button and a pop-up box that shows the full text when hovering the mouse on each of the to-do element)
