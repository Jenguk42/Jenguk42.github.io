## What is a `TextNode` object?

**`Text` inherits from `CharacterData` which in turn inherits from `Node`. **

- It only contains text content without any HTML or XML markup, making it possible to insert texts into the document as nodes.
- It is the `textContent` of its parent, not a separate child node. Therefore it does not have any identifier, including any property for id.

```javascript
// The text content of an element can be added like this:

var element = document.creteElement("div");
element.id = 1;

var elementContent = document.createTextNode("Hi I'm a text node");
elementContent.id = 2; // Will not work

element.appendChild(elementContent);
```

```html
<!-- The html created from the js above -->

<div id="1">
	"Hi I'm a text node" <!-- No id, just text -->
</div>
```


## Editing a `TextNode` object

There are several methods that can be used:

```javascript
const newContent = "Hi! I'm a new content";

// Only change the value of text node
element.firstChild.nodeValue = newContent;

// Overwrite the whole content into newContent
element.innerText = newContent;

// Use innerHTML when HTML parsing is neccessary
var paragraph = document.querySelector('p')
paragraph.innerHTML = "I'm an <em>emphasized</em> content"
```

- **`textContent`**
  - Gets the content of *all* TextNodes in the sub-tree as raw text.
  - The return value includes the text of hidden elements such as `<script>` and `<style>` .
- **`innerText`**
  - Gets the content of "human-readable" element as raw text.
  - Accessed as `element.innerText`
  - Takes styles into consideration and does not include the text of hidden elements such as `<script>` and `<style>`.
- **`nodeValue`**
  - Gets the content of the current node. (Same as `innerText`)
  - Accessed as `element.childNodes[0].nodeValue`
  - Used for best performance!
- **`innerHTML`**
  - Parses the content as `HTML`. (`text/html`)
  - Using `innerHTML` to insert text into a web page may create a potential security risk. (potential to become an attack vector on a site)
