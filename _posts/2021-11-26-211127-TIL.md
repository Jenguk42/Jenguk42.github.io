I added the following details to the to-do list project:

- Adding the input into the ordered list using `Element.innerHTML`
- Checking if the input is empty

I had little time to code today, but I still made some progress. (I went to a Banksy exhibition but it wasn't worth it ðŸ™„)



The next steps are:
1. Storing the to-do elements as different nodes to modify them separately!
1. Creating a delete button and a pop-up box that shows the full text when hovering the mouse on each of the to-do element
