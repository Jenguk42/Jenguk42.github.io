I added the following details to the to-do list project:

- Adding the input into the ordered list using `Element.innerHTML`
- Checking if the input is empty

I had little time to code today, but I still made some progress. (I went to a Banksy exhibition but it wasn't worth it ðŸ™„)



If the input is empty, the browser reminds the user to be productive.

If the input is not empty, then the it is saved in the ordered list.

The next steps are:

1. Storing the to-do elements as different nodes to modify them separately!
1. Creating a delete button and a pop-up box that shows the full text when hovering the mouse on each of the to-do element
