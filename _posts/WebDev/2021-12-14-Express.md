## What is Express?

A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist back-end framework for Node.js. It can be combined with client-side frameworks like React, Angular & Vue to build full stack applications.

You can build an API with Express so that it takes request from the front-end and serves back data in JSON format.

- Unopinionated: not a high level framework, does not require any fixed design, you have full control of handling the requrest to the server.

## Why use Express?

- Light, fast, free, and popular
- Makes building web apps with Node.js much easier: full control of request and response
- Used for both APIs with JSON data and back-end applications
- It's all JavaScript; great to use with client side frameworks

## Basic server syntax

```jsx
const express = require('express');

// Init express
const app = express();

// Create your endpoints/route handlers
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
    res.send('Hello World!');
})

// Listen on a port
app.listen(5000);
```

## Basic route handling

What can you do within your route?

- Fetch data from a database (MongoDB, MySQL, etc)
- Load pages
- Return JSON data
- Full access to request and response
  - `req` object represents the HTTP request properties for things like URL parameters, query strings, any data sent within the body, HTTP headers, etc.
  - `res` object represents the HTTP response, and you can use this object to send back JSON data, return template, redirect, etc.
- Parse any incoming data with the Body Parser
- Routs can be stored in separate files and exported, since Express has a router.

## Using nodemon

Once the following code is added to `package.json`, you can run the file in developer mode via `npm run dev`. (`npm run start` is used for deployment)

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index",
    "dev": "nodemon index"
  }
```

## Creating a static server with Express

> Postman is used: an HTTP client to make requests to the server (get, put, post, delete, request, etc.)

```jsx
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Look for the environment variable, and set it to PORT
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server started on ${PORT}`));
```

`localhost:5000` will show `Cannot GET /`, which means that it cannot find a route handler for `/` (index page).

```jsx
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Create a route to go to a web page
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('<h1>Hello World!</h1>');
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server started on ${PORT}`));
```

Instead of adding a single h1, you can add a whole HTML file.

```jsx
// Create a route to go to a web page
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html'));
});
```

However, this is not ideal since you have to put a route manually for every single page. Express has functionality to make a certain folder as the static folder.

```jsx
// Create a route to go to a web page by setting a static folder
// .use() is a method used to include a middleware.
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
```

Any file within the public folder can be open without manually adding the route. i.e. `localhost:5000/about.html` will show `about.html` saved within the public folder. Instead of handling the content types and paths, you can just put the files in the public folder!

However, creating a static server that creates regular html files is not what you will usually use Express for. You will mostly create JSON APIs to connect from a front-end or render templates where you can insert dynamic data.

## Middleware functions

A middleware is a stack of functions that executes whenever a request is made to a server. These functions have access to the request and response objects. Express has its own middleware, just like how 3rd party packages do. It takes three arguments: `req`, `res`, and `next`. `next()` calls the next function in the stack.

Middlewares can:

- Execute any code
- Make changes to the request/response objects
- End response cycle
- Call next middleware in the stack (with the next function)

```jsx
const moment = require("moment");

const app = express();

// Create a middleware that prints the url
const logger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(
    `${req.protocol}://${req.get("host")}${
      req.originalUrl
    }: ${moment().format()}`
  );
  next();
};
```

Everytime a request is made, the logger is executed. If a GET request is made (i.e. GET `http://localhost:5000/api/members`), it will print something like `http://localhost:5000/api/members: 2021-12-15T19:40:33+09:00` to the console.

## GET request

### Creating a JSON API

 Data used:

```jsx
// Members.js const members = [
    {
        id: 1,
        name: 'John Doe',
        email: 'john@gmail.com',
        status: 'active'
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        name: 'Bob Williams',
        email: 'bob@gmail.com',
        status: 'inactive'
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        name: 'Shannon Jackson',
        email: 'shannon@gmail.com',
        status: 'active'
    },
];

module.exports = members;
```

### Getting the members list

The code below gets all members, by returning the members as a JSON file. `res.json(members)` will return a JSON file without using `JSON.stringify`. You can send a GET request on `http://localhost:5000/api/members` on Postman, and retrieve the members list in a JSON file.

```jsx
// index.js
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const members = require('./members');

// Gets all members
app.get('/api/members', (req, res) => res.json(members));

// Set static folder
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

// Look for the environment variable, and set it to PORT
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server started on ${PORT}`));
```

If you send a GET request on `http://localhost:5000/api/members` using nodemon, you can retrieve the members in a JSON file.

```jsx
// Get single member
app.get("/api/members/:id", (req, res) => {
  // :id represents an input of any id.
  // req.params.id returns the id of the request as a string.
  const found = members.some(member => member.id === parseInt(req.params.id));

  if (found) {
    // If the id exists, return the JSON representation of the member.
    res.json(members.filter(member => member.id === parseInt(req.params.id)));
  } else {
    // If it doesn't, change the status and send a message
    res.status(400).json({ msg: `No member with the id of ${req.params.id}` })
  }
})
```

### Using a router

You can separate the router to a different file.

```jsx
// index.js
const express = require("express");
const path = require("path");

const app = express();

// Set static folder
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "public")));

// Members API Routes
// first param: route, second param: file
app.use('/api/members', require('./routes/api/members'));

// Look for the environment variable, and set it to PORT
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server started on ${PORT}`));
```

### Getting a single member

```jsx
// members.js in routes/api
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const members = require("../../members");

// Gets all members
router.get("/", (req, res) => res.json(members));

// Get single member
router.get("/:id", (req, res) => {
    const found = members.some(member => member.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
  
    if (found) {
      res.json(members.filter(member => member.id === parseInt(req.params.id)));
    } else {
      res.status(400).json({ msg: `No member with the id of ${req.params.id}` })
    }
  })

module.exports = router;
```

## POST request

### Using a body parser

```jsx
// members.js

// Send the given data to response
router.post('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send(req.body);
});
```

The code above sends the body of the request to the response.

Sending a POST request using postman:
![header]()
![body]()

You need to use a body parser to parse the data sent into the body. You can initialize the parser as a middleware.

```jsx
// index.js

// Body Parser Middleware
app.use(express.json()); // handle raw json
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false })); // handle form submissions
```

### Adding a member

```jsx
// Create member
router.post('/', (req, res) => {
  // Add a new member
  const newMember = {
    id: uuid.v4(),
    name: req.body.name,
    email: req.body.email,
    status: 'active'
  }

  // Bad request if name or email nonexisting
  if (!newMember.name || !newMember.email) {
    return res.status(400).json( { msg: 'Please include a name and email' });
  } 

  // Add the new member to the array
  members.push(newMember);

  // Return the entire array
  res.json(members);
});
```

When the email is not provided:
When both name and email are provided:

When dealing with new API, you deal with real database instead of a file with your data. In that case, you install a package to connect to the database (i.e. Mongoose for MongoDB). Rather than pushing the new member to the array, you use a method such as `members.save(newMember)`.

## PUT request

### Updating a member

```jsx
// Update member

router.put("/:id", (req, res) => {
  // Check to see if the member exists.
  const found = members.some(member => member.id === parseInt(req.params.id));

  if (found) {
    // If the id exists, 
    const updMember = req.body;
    members.forEach(member => {
      // If the member has the same id as the given id, then change the updated parameter.
      if (member.id === parseInt(req.params.id)) {
        member.name = updMember.name ? updMember.name : member.name;
        member.email = updMember.email ? updMember.email : member.email;

        res.json( {msg: 'Member updated', member });
      }
    });

  } else {
    // If it doesn't, change the status and send a message
    res.status(400).json({ msg: `No member with the id of ${req.params.id}` })
  }
})
```

Sending a PUT request using postman:
![updated]()

## DELETE request

```jsx
// Delete member

router.delete("/:id", (req, res) => {
  const found = members.some((member) => member.id === parseInt(req.params.id));

  if (found) {
    // If the id exists, filter out the id and 
    // return all the members except the one that was deleted
    res.json({
      msg: "Member deleted",
      members: members.filter(
        (member) => member.id !== parseInt(req.params.id)
      ),
    });
  } else {
    // If it doesn't, change the status and send a message
    res.status(400).json({ msg: `No member with the id of ${req.params.id}` });
  }
});
```
