## What is Express?

A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist back-end framework for Node.js. It can be combined with client-side frameworks like React, Angular & Vue to build full stack applications.

You can build an API with Express so that it takes request from the front-end and serves back data in JSON format.

- Unopinionated: not a high level framework, does not require any fixed design, you have full control of handling the requrest to the server.

## Why use Express?

- Light, fast, free, and popular
- Makes building web apps with Node.js much easier: full control of request and response
- Used for both APIs with JSON data and back-end applications
- It's all JavaScript; great to use with client side frameworks

## Basic server syntax

```jsx
const express = require('express');

// Init express
const app = express();

// Create your endpoints/route handlers
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
    res.send('Hello World!');
})

// Listen on a port
app.listen(5000);
```

## Basic route handling

What can you do within your route?

- Fetch data from a database (MongoDB, MySQL, etc)
- Load pages
- Return JSON data
- Full access to request and response
  - `req` object represents the HTTP request properties for things like URL parameters, query strings, any data sent within the body, HTTP headers, etc.
  - `res` object represents the HTTP response, and you can use this object to send back JSON data, return template, redirect, etc.
- Parse any incoming data with the Body Parser
- Routs can be stored in separate files and exported, since Express has a router.

## Express middleware

A middleware is a stack of functions that executes whenever a request is made to a server. These functions have access to the request and response objects. Express has its own middleware, just like how 3rd party packages do. Middlewares can:

- Execute any code
- Make changes to the request/response objects
- End response cycle
- Call next middleware in the stack (with the next function)
