I have finished learning the basics of  JavaScript! ðŸŒ¼

I looked at:

- How to create and use functions in JS
- What an object is, and how it can be used along with its properties and methods
- How to separate JS from html using different files and an `<src>` tag
- What are library and framework, and how they are different

The [last few tutorial videos](https://opentutorials.org/course/3085/18888) from Coding Everybody were really inspiring! The lecturer mentioned that we should try a project that solves a real-life problem using the least tools possible, only ensuring that "what needs to be executed is executed." I should probably go back to watching videos and reading books only when I run into my limits. I'll probably start a new project tomorrow!
