I started my very first (and tiny) JavaScript project, creating a to-do list! ðŸ˜º

I looked at:

- Creating a html file with (1) a text box with a `placeholder` (2) a button that creates an alert  (and that's pretty much it haha)

- Some basic attributes of html input type `text`

  

The page looks like this for now:

And creates the following alert box (which doesn't actually add anything to the list):

The next steps are:

1. Storing the input (Should I let the browser remember it when refreshed? Check JS methods for saving cookies)
1. Creating a function to print all the stored input
1. Maybe creating a delete button and a pop-up box that shows the full text when hovering the mouse on each of the to-do element?

Way to go! ðŸ˜Š
