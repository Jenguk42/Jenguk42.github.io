I started my very first (and tiny) JavaScript project! ðŸ˜º

I looked at:

- Creating an html file with (1) a text box with a `placeholder` (2) a button that creates an alert  (and that's pretty much it haha)
- Some basic attributes of html input type `text`
- The very basics of CSS: `style` element, selectors such as `span`, `class`, and `id`
- Application of conditional statements, arrays, and iteration on JS
- How to refactor a JS code using `this` and setting a new `var`
