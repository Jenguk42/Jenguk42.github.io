I started my very first (and tiny) JavaScript project, creating a to-do list! ðŸ˜º

I looked at:

- Creating an html file with (1) a text box with a `placeholder` (2) a button that creates an alert  (and that's pretty much it haha)

- Some basic attributes of html input type `text`

  

The page looks like this for now:

![Screenshot of the html 1](/Jenguk42.github.io/assets/images/todolist/1.jpg)

And creates the following alert box (which doesn't actually add anything to the list):

![Screenshot of the html2](/Jenguk42.github.io/assets/images/todolist/1.jpg)



The next steps are:

1. Storing the input (Should I let the browser remember it when refreshed? Check JS methods for saving cookies)
1. Creating a function to print all the stored input
1. Maybe creating a delete button and a pop-up box that shows the full text when hovering the mouse on each of the to-do element?

Way to go! ðŸ˜Š
