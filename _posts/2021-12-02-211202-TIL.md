I am learning React.js by following a crash course! ðŸ˜Ž I learned:

- How to create a react server, run it locally and edit it
- The basic grammar of React: what UI  components, states, and hooks are
- Some JS functions like `filter()`, `map()`
- JavaScript arrow functions

I am finding the crash course very helpful. Using a JavaScript library feels like taking a nice shortcut. Turns out all the work I have done with vanilla JavaScript in the past week could have been managed in a single line of React! ðŸ¤¯

Next up:

- Check the exact syntax of `useState()` function
- [Keep learning React JS from 57:02!](https://youtu.be/w7ejDZ8SWv8)
