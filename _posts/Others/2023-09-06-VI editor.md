VI is useful in a CLI-only envireonment, especially when changing remote configurations in a service.

## Basics
- `vi sample.txt` Creates a text file
- A tilde `~` represents an unused line; if there is an empty line without the tilde, there is a newline or tab character present
- `:q!` quits the editor (quit)
- `:w!` saves the change in file (write)
- `:w newfile.txt` save as newfile.txt 
- `:wq!` saves the file and quits the editor

## Modes in VI
VI is a model editor that has two modes: Command and Insert
1. Command mode
    - Default mode
    - Enables administrative tasks (i.e. saving the file, executing commands, moving cursor, etc)
    - Use this mode when you want to move around the file without changing it ("a safe place")
2. Insert mode
    - Enables you to insert text into file
    - Hit `i` to change to insert mode
    - Hit `esc` to get out of insert mode`

## Making changes in file
- Deleting 
    - `dd`: delete a whole line
        - `n dd`: delete n lines
    - `D`: delete the text on the right side of the cursor 
- Reverting
    - `u`: undo the last action
    - Ctrl `r`: redo the last action

## Command mode
- Searching
    - Special characters must be preceded by a backslash (i.e. `\n`)
    - Hit Enter: take cursor to the first character of the first match
    - `/pattern` performs a forward search; it pattern matches the text after the cursor
        - `N` to continue searching
    - `?pattern` performs a backward search; it pattern matches the text before the cursor
        - `n` to continue searching

- Search and replace
    - `:%s/pattern/replace/gc`
        - Replace `pattern` with `replace`
        - `g` changes all occurences (greedy)
        - `c` asks for confirmation

- Changing display using `:set` 
    - `nu`: display line numbers on the left hand side
    - `wm`: word wrap the text 
        - `wm=2`: set word wrap margin to 2 characters
