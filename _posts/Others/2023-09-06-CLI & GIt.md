## Basic CLI
```java
package app;

class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
}
```

The above code can be run on command line
```bash
$ java app/App.java
>> Hello World
```

`-d <directory>` specifies where to place generated class files
```bash
$ javac -d ../bin/ app/App.java
```

`cat` lets you preview what is in the file
```bash
# Preview App.java file
$ cat Simple/src/app/App.java
```

`diff` lets you check the difference between two files
```bash
$ diff text1.txt text2.txt
```


# Git 

## Creating and merging branches
Creating a branch named test
```bash
$ git branch test 
```

Changing current branch to test
```bash
$ git checkout test
```

Merging changes made in test into main
```bash
$ git checkout main
$ git merge test
$ git push origin main
```

## Deleting branches
Deleting a branch
```bash
# Delete test branch locally
$ git branch -d test

# Delete test branch remotely
$ git push origin --delete test
```

Temporary revert to a previous commit
- Creates a temporary branch that contains files committed  with the given code
- Committing changes to this branch will not alter the main branch
```bash
$ git checkout 5f85982c81f05335cddd5fa952d4e2574825db4d
```

Creating a new branch that is reverted to a previous commit
- `test` branch contains files committed with the given code
```bash
$ git checkout -b test 5f85982c81f05335cddd
```

## Excluding IDE files from Git
Use .gitignore
```bash
# Eclipse files
*/.classpath
*/.project
*/.settings
```

## Git misc
- `git log` shows the commits I have made
- `git commit -am "..."` does both -a and -m 
- `git restore --staged <filename>` unstages the commit
- Conflicts happen when remote is out of sync with the main branch. Decide which to keep and delete the conflicts, then merge again.
