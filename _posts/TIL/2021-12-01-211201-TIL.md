I explored some JavaScript libraries today. Turns out there is a whole bunch of different libraries with specific functionalities. My goal for now is to learn React and jQuery to the point where I can clone code Netflix. (By the end of January)

Also found this cool roadmap for a back-end developer! Once I'm confident with the two libraries I will focus on OS knowledge.
