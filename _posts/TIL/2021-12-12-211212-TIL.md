I started a small project! ðŸ˜€

I got the idea from a friend, who was in need of a program that can shuffle the members in a community platform called Naver BAND. So I started by creating a simple program that extracts the user names from a BAND member page and shuffles them. It works perfectly on console!

My intention was to create an application with JavaScript that can be run on Chrome, and I figured out the only way to do it is by creating a chrome extension. Which is my new project!

I'm thinking of adding more features like extracting n random people, grouping the members by certain criteria, and so on.

Next up:

- Continue the Node.js crash course
- Keep working on the project!
