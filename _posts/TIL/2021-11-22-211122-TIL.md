I mainly focused on Javascript today! ðŸ¥°

I looked at:
- What JS is and how it is different from Java (which I am rather familiar with) as a computing language
- How to get started with JS using a console
- Basic syntax of JS (declarations, variable and function hoisting, different types of literals)
- Some unfamiliar statements (`label`, `for...in` and `for...of`)

It's my first time learning  a loosely typed language like JS, and it's pretty cool how flexible it can be. 
The plan for this week is to get a clear understanding of JS and think of a project I could do using the language.
