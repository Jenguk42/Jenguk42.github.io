I'm done updating the project! ðŸŽ‰

Codes from `AddForm.js` was not reused since there were some differences in the layout as well as the functions that are passed in. The changes made in the editing session of `Task` are saved as `editText`, `editData`, and `editReminder`, then passed into a function in `App.js` to change the value of tasks.

I also added a footer with a cat because why not.
The final result looks like this!
