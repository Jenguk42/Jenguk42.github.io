I learned some basic CSS and applied it to the project. ðŸ¥°

- The page looks neater overall!
- I refactored the code by creating the `createButton` function.
- A 'done' button is added, which changes the style of the task element.
- Added a git icon that leads to my GitHub.
- Added a cat gif at the bottom because why not...
- Also made some notes about the basics of CSS!

The page looks like this now:

The next steps are:

1. Learn jQuery and other JavaScript libraries
1. And do some more projects!
