I focused on the Express crash course. ðŸŽ‡

I learned how to:

- Use Postman to handle requests:
  - Getting the members list (GET)
  - Getting a single member (GET)
  - Adding a member (POST)
  - Updating a member (PUT)
  - Deleting a member (DELETE)
- Separate the router to a different file
- Use a body parser to send the given data to response

Next up:

- Finish the Express crash course!
