I finished the Node.js crash course! üòÅ I learned:

- How to create an actual web server
- Setting dynamic file extensions and paths
- Deploying the application via Heroku

I think I get the overall idea! It's time to implement what I learned in a project. Once I'm done with the chrome extension I will also come up with a small project that uses Node. I'll probably add a database to the task management application so people can sign up and save their tasks.

Next up:

- Work on the BAND chrome extension!
- Learn Express JS
- Add a database to the task management app
