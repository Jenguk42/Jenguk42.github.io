I'm back on recording my daily process! 

<br> Today I have done the following:
- Brush up on Java by completing challenges on codewars
    - Reviewed `String.format()`
    - Reviewed mapping functions
- Fixed the frontend code of IELTS consultation web app: 
    - The user & bot responses were saved repeatedly and sent to openai, resulting in an incoherent answer.
    - Fixed by making simple changes in the while loop. 

Next up:
- More challenges on Java!
- Continue on Java advanced course
