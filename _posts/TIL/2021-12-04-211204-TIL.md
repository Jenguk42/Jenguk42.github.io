I spent most of my time reviewing React.

- Tried modifying the vanilla JS todo-list project with React
- Also made some notes for Hooks in React.js

I totally need some more practice. ðŸ˜‘ Stuff seemed easy while watching the course, but it still took a lot of time to modify a tiny bit of the existing code without looking at the source code. 

At least I have the components for my header, buttons, and the add task form. The renewed version looks like this for now. (The button doesn't do anything yet)
