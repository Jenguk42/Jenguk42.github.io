The to-do list project is very close to reaching perfection! ðŸ˜Š

- The hard-coded numbering system is fixed, so each task is a list object within an ordered list. (The order of the list is automatically rearranged when a task is deleted.)
- Each task now has an edit button!
- I also made some notes about different methods used for editing a text node.

An edit button is created along with the done button.

When clicking on the edit button, an input text box appears. It contains the previous value of the task, and can be modified.

When the enter button is clicked, the browser notifies that a change is made, and the value of the task is updated.

Since each task is a list object within an ordered list, the order is automatically rearranged when a task is deleted.

The next steps are:

1. Sprucing up the page via CSS!
1. Checking on other people's to-do list projects to see what else they have added
