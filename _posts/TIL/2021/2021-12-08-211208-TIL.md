I learned jQuery today! âœŒ

- Read w3school document about jQuery and made notes
- Created a project using jQuery (a simple calculator!)

Here is my calculator!

![calculator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54295374/145245590-073c99af-f42f-424a-800b-61be3c322b08.gif)

The calculator handles long sequence of calculation via reusing four global variables, `num1`, `num2`, `operator`, and `total`.

When the second operator is added to the sequence, the existing expression is calculated and saved in `num1`. For example, if `+` is clicked after `1+2`, the value of `1+2` is saved in `num1` so the user can continue their calculation. The screen display would be showing `3+`, and the calculator will be waiting for the input to save in `num2`.

Some edge cases were considered too:

- When there is a decimal point in the value, you cannot add another one.
- When an operator is clicked after another operator, the old one is discarded.
- When you click the equal button after an operator, the action is ignored. <br><br>

Next up:

- Fix the bug that causes `Uncaught TypeError` When you click the equal button with an input of only one number (make the result equal to the given number)
- Look into Node.js when I'm confident enough with jQuery!
