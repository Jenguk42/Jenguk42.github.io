I worked on the popup page of the chrome extension project, and looked into the architecture of a content script. ðŸš—

I learned about:

- How to access DOM of a web page
- Isolated worlds of content scripts
- Injecting scripts with static declarations
- How to communicate with the embedding page

Next up:

- Try to get `content-script.js` working only on `https://band.us/band/*`
