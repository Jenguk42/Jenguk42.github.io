I added even more details to the to-do list project! ðŸ¥°

- Handling each element separately by creating a delete button (and also made some notes about the difference between `addEventListener()` method and `onclick` property)

- Emptying the text box after the add button is clicked

The content of the to-do list looks like an ordered list, but the to-do elements are actually separated by `<div>` tags.

When clicking on a button, a new dialog is displayed, informing that the task is finished. The task is then removed from the list.

Also the alert is simplified, because displaying the content of the to-do element is not really necessary.

The next steps are:

1. Sprucing up the whole page via CSS!
1. Rearranging the order of the list when an element is deleted
1. Adding an edit button for each element
