I learned more React today! ðŸ˜€

- Followed a tutorial to create a simple tictactoe game
- Still improving the vanila JS project
- Also made some notes for template literals and event objects (target properties) in JS

The todo list looks like this now:

Next up:
- Editing vanila project: make `isEditing`, `isDone` into states instead of functions passed in as props
- Finish the JS array functions worksheet
- Start looking at jQuery
