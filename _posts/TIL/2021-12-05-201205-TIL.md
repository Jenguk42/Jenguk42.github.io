I learned more React today! ðŸ˜€

- Followed a tutorial to create a simple tictactoe game
- Still improving the vanila JS project
- Also made some notes for template literals and event objects (target properties) in JS

I added `Tasks.js` and `Task.js` to list the tasks below the add form box. Tasks are saved as states in the global level, at `App.js`. I am trying to add two more icons next to the delete button that edit the task and show it as finished. I should probably add some states to handle the different styles.

The todo list looks like this now:

Next up:
- Editing vanila project: make `isEditing`, `isDone` into states instead of functions passed in as props
- Finish the JS array functions worksheet
