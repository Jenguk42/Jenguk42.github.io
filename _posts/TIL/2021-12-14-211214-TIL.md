I started an Express crash course! ðŸ˜Ž <br>
I learned:

- The basic syntax of an Express server
- Route handling and middleware
- How to create a static server with Express

Also looked at:

- The exact definition of REST API's
- The chrome extension architecture

I will have to spend some time learning the Chrome API. ðŸ˜‚ The changes made to Manifest V3 from V2 are a bit confusing.

Next up:

- Finish the Express crash course
- Read more about chrome extension: Manifest V3, and figure out how to retrieve the DOM content
