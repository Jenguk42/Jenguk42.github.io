I'm still practicing React.js! ðŸ˜‰

- I made some notes about JS array functions like `some()`, `filter()`, etc.
- Also made some more changes on the react todo list project.

There are minor changes to the layout of the project:
- Tasks with reminder set as true have a bar at the left side, instead of having a background color.
- An ellipsis icon is added for each task to hide the three icons, and GRID was used instead of flex box to improve the overall layout.

I implemented the edit and done functionalities by introducing new states, `isDone` and `editing` to `Task.js`. Since the task element is saved in the top level, edit function was added to `App.js` and passed into other components as props.

Now the task values are modified successfully, but I still need to work on getting new values from the user. The edit box that should be added share a lot of components with `AddForm.js`, so I will probably modify and reuse it.

The todo list looks like this now:
