## Why Git?

- Git was created to maintain version control of the Linux operating system kernel
- It is an important part of software computer systems
- Good practice for all programming tasks

## Version Control Systems

- Track and control changes over files
- Use it for:
  - Collaboration
  - Revision history
  - Audit changes
  - *Not backup, since the data is lost if the server goes down*

## Git - Architecture

- Distributed version control: changes stored remotely by syncing repositories
- "snapshots" of the current project: directed acrylic graph (DAG)

- 3 steps
  - Working directory: top level folder with single version of the files
  - Staging area: file in .git that records files to be added to next commit
  - .git directory: configuration and repository database

- Storage
  - Git does not store deltas (changes), it takes snapshots (new copy) of the file system
  - Files that are the same are referenced, not duplicated
  - This is a big difference compared to other VCS
    - Branching is easier and cheaper
  - Git occasionally packs the snapshots into single files, and uses delta compression to save space
    - `git gc --aggressive`
    - Automatic process
    - Keeping recent files non-delta exploits locality (like chaching)
  - Delta vs Snapshots

    - Delta: record the changes made
    - Snapshot: taking copy (Git does this, which leads to faster branch merging)

## Using git

- Git - local file structure
  - `git init` initialises a repo, which creates a `.git` folder
    - Full history of the files in the repo are saved here
    - Cloning a repo copies `.git` from the remote repository

- Git database
  - Putting a value in the database returns a SHA1 hash
  - Key-value database 
    - key: SHA1 hash (40 hex-character identifier)
      - provides integrity, but not secure; the purpose of hash is unique association
      - value: stored as *blob* in the objects folders

- Staging
  - Process of marking the file as to be included in the next commit
