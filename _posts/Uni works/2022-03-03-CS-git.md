## Why Git?

- Git was created to maintain version control of the Linux operating system kernel
- It is an important part of software computer systems
- Good practice for all programming tasks

## Version Control Systems

- Track and control changes over files
- Use it for:
  - Collaboration
  - Revision history
  - Audit changes
  - *Not backup, since the data is lost if the server goes down*

## Git - Architecture

- Distributed version control: changes stored remotely by syncing repositories
- "snapshots" of the current project: directed acrylic graph (DAG)

- 3 steps
  - Working directory: top level folder with single version of the files
  - Staging area: file in .git that records files to be added to next commit
  - .git directory: configuration and repository database

- Storage
  - Git does not store deltas (changes), it takes snapshots (new copy) of the file system
  - Files that are the same are referenced, not duplicated
  - This is a big difference compared to other VCS
    - Branching is easier and cheaper
  - Git occasionally packs the snapshots into single files, and uses delta compression to save space
    - `git gc --aggressive`
    - Automatic process
    - Keeping recent files non-delta exploits locality (like chaching)
  - Delta vs Snapshots

    - Delta: record the changes made
    - Snapshot: taking copy (Git does this, which leads to faster branch merging)

## Using git

- Git - local file structure
  - `git init` initialises a repo, which creates a `.git` folder
    - Full history of the files in the repo are saved here
    - Cloning a repo copies `.git` from the remote repository

- Git database
  - Putting a value in the database returns a SHA1 hash
  - Key-value database 
    - key: SHA1 hash (40 hex-character identifier)
      - provides integrity, but not secure; the purpose of hash is unique association
      - value: stored as *blob* in the objects folders

- Staging
  - Process of marking the file as to be included in the next commit
  - Staging command: `git add`
    - Adds a key-value for the file contents
    - Adds the file path to the staging index

- Committing
  - The comit itself is a git object
  - Creates a git *tree* object of the changes, and wraps them in a commit
  - The *tree* object contains Unix directory entries (permissions, path, blob key)

- Git log
  - Displays the log of activity
  - Always retrieved locally, since all operations are performed on the local repository

- Git checkout
  - Checking out: switching the working tree to a particular commit/branch (generally the head)
  - Sets the *HEAD* to the current branch or commit
    - All subsequent operations are performed on this branch
  - `git checkout main`
    - Returns to the most recent version
    - `main` tells it to checkout the HEAD of the main branch
    - When you check out a specific commit you create a detached branch (you are no longer on the main branch)

- Git HEAD
  - File `.git/HEAD` contains a reference to the currently checked out commit
  - If it is a commit hash it is a detached branch
  - Normally it is a branch reference (`refs/heads/main`)
  - Used to determine which branch current changes apply to

## Git Branches

Branches are text files pointing to a different commit.

- Specific commits can be checked out as branches, but generally we branch from an existing branch (initially main)
- Far more efficient than having to duplicate workspace (SVN)
  - Smaller storage space, quicker to create and merge
- Recommended workflow is to branch and merge
- `git checkout -b devbranch main`
  - Checks out master and creates a new branch: `devbranch`

## Remote usage of git

- Clone sets the remote references in the git config file
  - Called "origin"
  - Remote references are URLs to your remote repository
- Pull performs 1. fetch and 2. merge
  - Fetch: retrieves any changes from the remote
  - Merge: combine those changes into local repo
- Push transfers your local commits to the remote repo

## Real world use of Git

- Tags: used to add more informative names to commits
- A release is also often stored on a branch:
  - Allows bug fixing to continue without impact on future development
- Git does not solve inherent conflicts; general workflow is to commit/push often (with small changes)
- Binary files can be inefficient to store in git
  - File changes are packed using delta compression
  - Binary files typically exhibit large changes
  - Increases the size of the clone operation
- Forks complete separate copy of repository
  - Link remains to parent
  - Useful for large changes, keep development work out of main repo
  - Remains even if original repo is removed

## Continuous integration

- Uploading a test everytime you do a commit: snippets of code running after push (i.e. test cases)
- Important part of sw development
- Continuously build, test, and deploy iterative code Changes
- Reduce the chance of maintaining test-failing code
